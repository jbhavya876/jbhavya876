### 🚀 About Me
> A vision-driven Computer Science engineering student with an obsessive passion for building backend-heavy, future-oriented tech from the ground up to the sky on the blockchain environment.

- 🔧 Currently Backend Intern at a leading tech company, crafting scalable services.
- 💡 Building at the intersection of **Blockchain, AI**, and **Secure Infrastructure**.
- 🔍 Exploring the gaps in the tech landscape to build niche, high-impact solutions.
- 🌐 Focused on **privacy-first**, **trust-verifiable**, and **nation-scale** systems.

### 🧠 My Approach to Tech & Problem Solving
> I believe **great engineering is about understanding root causes**, not just applying tools.

- I approach problems with a **bottom-up architecture mindset**: from cryptographic primitives to network protocols to API surface.
- I focus on **scalability**, **modularity**, and **future-proofing** the stack.
- I ask: _“Can this be audited, scaled, and secured — even under worst-case scenarios?”_
