<h1 align="center">👋 Hey there, I'm Bhavya Jain</h1> <p align="center"> <em>Smart Contract Developer | Cryptography Researcher | Zero-Knowledge & DevOps Enthusiast | Aspiring Protocol Engineer</em> </p>
🚀 About Me

A backend engineer and security researcher passionate about building cryptographically secure, scalable systems for modern infrastructures — especially those shaping the future of governance, identity, and defense.

🔭 Currently engineering trust-verifiable and privacy-preserving architectures using blockchain and cryptography.

🧱 Founder of AlterBlock — building nation-scale, post-quantum secure digital infrastructure for India.

🛡️ Deep interest in zero-knowledge systems, post-quantum cryptography, and protocol design.

🎯 I don’t just build — I architect systems that can stand the test of time, scale, and computation.

📖 Research Publication

📄 Post-Quantum Cryptography: A Comprehensive Review
🗓️ Jan 2025 – May 2025 (Published)
🧠 Quantum Security Meets Real-World Cryptography

Evaluated Shor’s and Grover’s impacts on RSA, ECC, and symmetric ciphers.

Analyzed PQC families — Lattice, Code, Multivariate, and Hash-Based cryptography.

Reviewed NIST PQC standardization process and hybrid migration strategies.

Proposed a backend-oriented PQC implementation framework for real-world systems.

🧩 Projects & Implementations

🔹 ZK-Proof Fibonacci

Circom + SnarkJS implementation to verify Fibonacci sequences without exposing private inputs.

🔹 ElectraX

Geospatial optimization engine integrating AI and smart contracts for EV charging station deployment.

🔹 Ebbix

A decentralized content streaming platform — IPFS-backed video storage and Ethereum micropayments.

🔹 [ZK-Comms (WIP)]
A privacy-preserving communication protocol leveraging zk-SNARKs and off-chain authentication.

🧠 Problem-Solving Philosophy

“I think like a protocol engineer — not just a developer.”

🧩 Bottom-up architecture — build from primitives, not abstractions.

🔐 Zero-trust design — security is a default, not a layer.

🧠 Scalability through modularity — every module is testable, verifiable, and replaceable.

🚀 Constantly asking: Can this scale globally? Can it survive a quantum world?

🌍 Vision & Future Endeavours

Building for the Post-AI, Post-Quantum era — where privacy, performance, and provability converge.

🛰️ AlterBlock: Laying the foundation for a trust-verifiable blockchain infrastructure.

🔐 Designing digital identity systems fortified by PQC and ZK proofs.

🤖 Innovating at the intersection of AI + backend resilience for mission-critical systems.

💼 Long-term goal: Protocol engineering in blockchain R&D or national security orgs.

💡 Life Principle

“Build secure. Think long-term. Operate with depth.”
Because the next era won’t just demand speed — it’ll demand truth, integrity, and resilience.
