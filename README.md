### 🚀 About Me
> A vision-driven Computer Science engineering student with an obsessive passion for building backend-heavy, future-oriented tech from the ground up to the sky on the blockchain environment.

- 🔧 Currently Backend Intern at a leading tech company, crafting scalable services.
- 💡 Building at the intersection of **Blockchain, AI**, and **Secure Infrastructure**.
- 🔍 Exploring the gaps in the tech landscape to build niche, high-impact solutions.
- 🌐 Focused on **privacy-first**, **trust-verifiable**, and **nation-scale** systems.

### 📖 Research Publication (2025)

📄 **Post-Quantum Cryptography: A Comprehensive Review**  
🗓️ *Jan 2025 – May 2025 (Under Publication)*  
🔍 *Assessing cryptographic risks in the quantum era*

**Highlights:**
- Assessed quantum threats to RSA, ECC, and symmetric cryptography using **Shor’s and Grover’s algorithms**.
- Compared leading PQC families: **lattice-based**, **code-based**, **multivariate**, and **hash-based** schemes.
- Analysed **NIST’s PQC standardisation process** with a focus on post-quantum protocol adoption.
- Proposed architecture-level implications of quantum-safe cryptography for future secure systems.

This research directly feeds into my goal of building **post-quantum-ready infrastructure** for **critical national and privacy-centric applications**.

### 🧠 My Approach to Tech & Problem Solving
> I believe **great engineering is about understanding root causes**, not just applying tools.

- I approach problems with a **bottom-up architecture mindset**: from cryptographic primitives to network protocols to API surface.
- I focus on **scalability**, **modularity**, and **future-proofing** the stack.
- I ask: _“Can this be audited, scaled, and secured — even under worst-case scenarios?”_
