### 🚀 About Me

> A backend designer with strong technical skills, business acumen, and a people-first mindset. I focus on building secure, scalable systems using cryptography and blockchain, especially for government and public platforms.

- 🎯 Driven by curiosity—always exploring new technologies, asking the right questions, and identifying the real problems.
- 🛡️ Passionate about **trust-verifiable systems**, **quantum-resistant cryptography**, and **privacy-preserving computation**.
- 🔭 Building projects that blend **backend precision** with **deep cryptographic principles**.
- 🧱 Founder of **AlterBlock** — visioned for nation-scale, post-quantum secure digital infrastructure.

### 📖 Research Publication

📄 **Post-Quantum Cryptography: A Comprehensive Review**  
🗓️ *Jan 2025 – May 2025 (Under Publication)*  
🧠 *Quantum Security Meets Real-World Cryptography*

- Analyzed Shor’s and Grover’s impact on RSA, ECC, and symmetric cryptosystems.
- Compared PQC schemes: **Lattice**, **Code**, **Multivariate**, and **Hash-Based**.
- Studied **NIST PQC standardization** and proposed hybrid transition models.
- Suggested implementation approaches for **post-quantum secure backends**.

### 🧠 Problem-Solving Philosophy

> I solve problems from the root by **thinking in primitives, not just APIs**.

- Follow a **bottom-up architectural mindset** — protocols first, interfaces second.
- Design with **modularity**, **composability**, and **zero-trust security** principles.
- Question everything: _“Can this be broken under quantum threat? Can it scale across regions?”_

### 🌍 Vision & Future Endeavours

> Building for the **post-AI, post-quantum era** — with privacy, performance, and provability.

- 🛰️ **AlterBlock**: Building nation-scale, trust-verifiable blockchain infrastructure.
- 🔐 Developing **digital identity solutions** backed by post-quantum cryptography.
- 🤖 Exploring intersections of **AI + backend** with defense-grade fault tolerance.
- 💼 Future goal: protocol engineering in blockchain R&D labs or security orgs.
